Ham-Device-FT817COMM version 0.9.0_01

  The Ham::Device::FT817COMM is a perl module which creates an object
oriented instance of the YAESU FT-817 ham radio and allows numerous
actions to be taken upon it.  All CAT functions of the radio are 
available, which include undocumented CAT functions to further increase
the functionality of the rig.

  Parsing of data is accomplished through several different subroutines
that also provided a limited but effective writeback freature, as the 
FT-817 does not have a checksum for serial communication. Overloading
the serial port or allowing for multiple users will easily cause data
to be corrupted.  While this is not important for the read features,
the write features can cause corrupted data in the EEPROM.

  It is recommended that if you are using this library, you take advantage
of the lockfile feature to lock the serial port to the pid of the program.
If you would like a multi-user application to read the data or statuses of
the radio it is recommended that it be done in the following manner:

1. Run a program which captures desired data at a given time interval.
2. Encode that data in a way that a second party could understand it.
3. Have that data update a text file on the server.

For situations where ajax is employed.  You should have the perl script
collecting the data put it in an array; then encode that array into a json
packet.  Finally writing that packet to a text file where a javascript
file can read the json packet in the file and update the desired dom elements.

More information will me included on ways to use the module in several 
different manners in the future.


This module depends on the perl Device::Serialport module and / or the
Win32::Serialport module to access the serial interface.  These modules
are available on and can be installed through CPAN.
